By 1987, more\n                than a dozen non-strict, purely functional programming languages\n                existed. Miranda was the most widely used, but it was\n                proprietary software. At the conference on Functional\n                Programming Languages and Computer Architecture (FPCA '87) in\n                Portland, Oregon, there was a strong consensus that a committee\n                be formed to define an open standard for such languages. The\n                committee's purpose was to consolidate existing functional\n                languages into a common one to serve as a basis for future\n                research in functional-language design.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                I don't know and better yet, I can't care.\n            </p>\n            <h2>Buttons</h2>\n            <div class=\"buttons\">\n                <h3>Active:</h3>\n                <button class=\"active\">Buy now!</button>\n                <h3>Cancel</h3>\n                <button class=\"cancel\">Nuke</button>\n                <h3>Info</h3>\n                <button class=\"warning\">Help</button>\n            </div>\n            <h2>Input</h2>\n            <label>Test:</label>\n            <input type=\"text\" name=\"\" id=\"\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"footer\">\n            <span>Made with a keyboard.
